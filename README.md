# Personalized_Hashtag_Recommendation_With_User_Demographic_data
Abstract
The usage of social media platforms has increased dramatically, andstudieshaveshown that hashtags—which are inherently linked to the delivery of targetedcontent—significantly increase user engagement. Many earlier studies have madeanefforttosuggest relevant hashtags for every social media user based on their postsbytakinginto account the key elements found in both text and images. User demographicdataisalso a major factor in how personalized hashtag recommendations aremade, helpingtodevelop this multidimensionality with hashtag recommendations. Therefore,inaddition to textual and visual data, this paper suggests using the demographichashtagrecommendation (DemoHash) model to leverage users’ demographicinformationextracted from their selfie images. The outcomes of our experimentsusingtheInstagram datasets demonstrate that our suggested model performs betterintermsof 1-score, Precision, and Recall. Our method successfully integratedbothuser-oriented and content-based modeling for customized hashtag recommendations.Amodel for personalized hashtag recommendation on microblogs, addressingthreeunexplored challenges in existing approaches. Firstly, it emphasizes capturingmultipleuser behaviors and relationships beyond first-order connections, includinguser-usersocial and hashtag-hashtag co-occurrences. Secondly, it focuses onpersonalizingcontent at a word level, considering individual user aspects for eachwordinamicroblog. Lastly, it extends hashtag correlation modeling to incorporatebothleft-sideand right-side correlations within microblogs. It employs a Multi-relationalAttentiveNetwork (MAN) to capture various relations and fruitful representationsofusersandhashtags. Additionally, extends to personalize content at the wordlevel. Themodelintegrates hashtag correlations in a sequenceless manner for effectiverecommendation.We apply this model on Twitter dataset to evaluate the performance.
Introduction
Social media platforms have developed into effective tools for communitybuilding,information sharing, and communication in today's hyperconnectedworld. Duetothefact that hashtags turn words and phrases into searchable and relatablethemes,theirwidespread use has had a significant impact on how users find andinteract withcontent. Nevertheless, hashtag efficacy varies amongst users; it is intrinsicallylinkedto personal traits and preferences. Our project, "DemoHash," introducesastateofthe-art hashtag recommendation system that leverages user demographicdatatosolvethis fundamental problem. DemoHash's main goal is to improve users' socialmediaexperiences by suggesting personalized, contextually appropriate hashtags. DemoHashis aiming to transform the way people engage with and consume content onsocialmedia platforms by taking into account their age, location, gender, interests, andotherfactors. We will examine the conception, creation, and applicationof DemoHashinthis project document, providing a thorough rundown of its features andbenefitsforcompanies and individual users alike. By utilizing cutting edge machinelearningalgorithms and data analysis, our goal is to close the gap between hashtagusagethatisgeneric and universally applicable and hashtags that actually speaktoindividualusers.An extensive analysis of DemoHash's goals, processes, features, technical architecture,and user manual will be provided in this document. Our goal is tofinishthisprojectwith a user-friendly hashtag recommendation systemthat can be easilyincorporatedinto different social media platforms, changing the way people interact withcontentand encouraging a more intimate online community and personalization.

Our goal is tofinishthisprojectwith a user-friendly hashtag recommendation systemthat can be easilyincorporatedinto different social media platforms, changing the way people interact withcontentand encouraging a more intimate online community and personalization. However,these approaches have significant limitations in fully capturing the essenceofhashtagrecommendations because most of them have used users' posts' imagesandtextsastheir primary features. Given the strong correlation between users' sociodemographicdata and how they use hashtags (Denton, Weston, Paluri, Bourdev, &Fergus,2015),making use of this data as one of the primary features can help recommendrelevanthashtags. Broadly speaking, user behavior on social networks canbeclassifiedaccording to various factors such as age (Jang, Han, Shih, &Lee, 2015), gender(Tomorn & Bao, 2020), culture (Sheldon, Rauschnabel, Antony, &Car, 2017),andsoon. Thus, the main goal of this project is to recommend user-personalizedhashtagsbyusing the demographic information of users as one of the primaryfeatures. Wealso
take into account their demographic data, such as age, gender, race, andemotion,aswell as the quantity of posts, followers, and introductory texts that theyhave. Wecreate a personalized hashtag recommendation model using such demographicdata.List of Modules:

Proposed Architecture / Framework:
Considering a set of text, image, and corresponding user demographicinformation,thetask of our approach is to effectively generate appropriate hashtags for eachpost.Toexamine this task for each post, multi-class classification is performed. Theoverviewof our proposed model is presented in Fig. 1. The image, andtext aswellasuserdemographic information, which is extracted using a selfie imageandeachuser’saccount information, are employed as the input. The output of the imagefeaturelayerfrom VGG-16 is 7 × 7 × 512. Then, we used dense layer includingtanhactivationfunction for 300 embedding size for feature concatenation. The text featureissettohaving maximum text-sequence length of 328. The LSTMlayer extractedtextfeatureof 300 embedding size. The 133 dimension of demographic feature, whichincludesage, gender, race, emotion, number of each user’s posts, thenumberoffollowings/followers, and his/her bio, was deployed as another input tothemodel.Forthe feature concatenation, demographic feature is also resizedtohaving300embedding size by dense layer with tanh activation. In addition, we usedadropoutrateof 0.75. The batch size of training procedures is set to 5, where thenumberofepochsis computationally obtained by dividing the number of train data bythebatchsize.Finally, the number of epoch is 10 and the parameters are trained byADAMoptimizer.

Literature Survey
Traditional Content-Based Approaches:
Traditional approaches for hashtag recommendation primarily relyoncontentsimilarity using statistical techniques such as TF-IDF and latent dirichlet allocation(LDA). TF-IDF is widely used to represent words based on their frequencyofappearance in a document. However, it tends to overlook the semanticinformationpresent in microblogs. Another method, LDA, identifies content similaritybasedontopics. Despite its effectiveness in longer documents, it may not performoptimallywith short texts in microblogs and does not consider the sequential natureofwords.Word Embedding Techniques:
Word2Vec, a popular word embedding technique, has shown promiseinbuildingwordrepresentations and has been applied to hashtag recommendation. This methodfocuseson learning word embeddings that capture semantic relationships betweenwords.Forinstance, EmTaggeR employs Word2Vec to learn word embeddings for
recommending hashtags. However, these approaches may fall short incapturingthesequential order of words within a microblog. Sequence Modeling Approaches:
Sequence modeling involves capturing the sequential nature of words withinamicroblog. Recurrent neural network (RNN) variants and convolutional neuralnetworks (CNN) are utilized to capture long-term dependencies andwordsequencepatterns. Models like MHG use bidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRU)tomodelmicroblogs and their conversation contexts. Another model, CNN-Attention, usesCNN with attention mechanisms to encode all words in a microblogandmakehashtagrecommendations. Transformer and Attention-Based Approaches:
Transformers, including variants like BERT, have gained prominenceinvariousnatural language processing tasks, including hashtag recommendation. Attentionmechanisms play a crucial role in these models, allowing themto capturetherelationships between different words and tokens. Models such as SANNleverageself-attention mechanisms to obtain microblog representations for makingrecommendations. EmHash, on the other hand, applies BERTembeddingstoobtainmicroblog representations for hashtag recommendation.
Hashtag Correlation Modeling:
Capturing hashtag correlations is a crucial aspect of effective hashtagrecommendation.Some recent approaches reformulate the recommendation task as hashtaggeneration,aiming to capture correlations among hashtags. For instance, ITAGadoptsagatedrecurrent unit (GRU) to model sequential text and combines it withhashtagcorrelationand content-tag overlapping for making recommendations. AMNNproposesahybridneural network to extract multimodal features and applies GRUtocapturehashtagcorrelations.
IMPLEMENTATION
Each text was embedded into sequences with an embeddingsizeof128,whereall words in the text are represented as vectors . The text canbeindicatedas,where denotes the maximum text length. Then, we adoptedalongshort-termmemory (LSTM) network with 300 units to maintain the sequential natureofthetext to generate text feature efficiently (Gers, Schmidhuber, &Cummins,2000).In each step, the current word embedding sequence and the output ofthepreviousunit ℎ−1 from the LSTM units were concatenated to obtaintheoutputwordrepresentation of ℎ. From the LSTM networks, we obtainoutput asthetextfeature matrix, and can be represented as Identical text featureextractionprocesswas employed to create inputs for both the baseline and our proposedmodels(Oh,Ji, Kim, Park, & del Pobil, 2022). The images were resizedto224×224tobeused as an input to the VGG-16 network pre trained model withtheImagenetdataset (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014). The outputs of the last poolinglayerofthe VGG network were extracted as the image features. Specifically, tensorsforthe 7 × 7 regions which is represented via a 512 dimensional vectorarekeptbythe multiple feature vectors for each image. That is, denotingas animagefeaturematrix, consists of 512. For the computational convenience, weaddedafullyconnected layer after VGG network to convert each D-dimensionalregionalfeature vector into a new vector with the same dimensionof thetextfeaturevectors. Therefore, the image feature matrix Demographicinformation.Weextracted users’ age, gender, race, and emotion fromthe collectedselfiepostsbyutilizing Deepface3 (Serengil & Ozpinar, 2021), where Deepfaceisalightweightface recognition and facial attribute analysis framework. Deepfacewasexaminedwith the VGG-Face model, while the output layers werecustomizedfordemographic prediction. The output layer for age predictionhas101nodes,andpredicts age levels from 0 to 100 years as a continuous variable. Theracemodelhas six outputs: Asian, Black, Latino Hispanic, Middle Eastern, andWhite.Asanexception, the emotion model is not examined with the VGGFacestructure,because of the limited channel numbers in the datasets. The emotionmodelhas5convolution layers and 3 fully connected layers, allowing users tohaveoneofthefollowing labels: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, andNeutral(Serengil & Ozpinar, 2021). The categorical values of gender, race, andemotionwere presented as integer values. Moreover, we additionallycollectedtheuserinformation which is organized by the number of each user’s posts, thenumberof followings/followers, and his/her bio. The bio indicates thetextoftheintroduction from the user’s profile. Each word of the user bioisembeddedasavector, and the embedded words are constructed to be representedinmatrixform.We concatenated age , gender , race , emotion , and collecteduserinformationthereby employing the combined demographic informationasdemographicinformation features."
RESULT AND ANALYSIS
We analyzed the performance gain of the proposed DemoHashmodel. Toanalyze the effectiveness Of the demographic feature, we variedthemodelswiththe following four components: (1) DemoHash, the text of users’ postsandtheimage of users’ posts (Text+Image); (2) DemoHash, image anduserdemographicinformation (Image+Demo) which is names as ; (3) DemoHash, text anddemographic information (Text+Demo); (4) DemoHash whichis ourproposedmodel, text, image, and the demographic information (Text+Image+Demo).Then,we varied the number of recommended hashtags from1 to 5toevaluateeachmodel under identical conditions. Table shows the summaryof theevaluationmetrics from all the variants. Compared to the variant, whichremovedthedemographic information from the input feature, the DemoHashmodel, allthemodels used demographic features outperformed from0.1%to3.5%intermsoff1 -score. With the number of one hashtag recommendation, our proposedmodeloutperformed all the other variants by average of 1.7%, 0.3%, and0.4%intermsof precision, recall,
